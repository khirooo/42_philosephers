# 42_philosephers
In this project, we learn the basics of threading a process.

In this project we simulate a round table with a number N of philospheres (threads) and a bowl of spaghetti. Each philosphere will have two forks (mutex) one on the left and one on the right and will only be able to eat if he can hold both forks. The goal is to have the philosophers alternate between eating in a way that none of them die. We will learn how to create threads and synchronize between them using mutexes.
